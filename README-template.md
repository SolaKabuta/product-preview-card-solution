## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow (actually I did the opposite but you shouldn't, oops)


### What I learned

I learned about media querries yesterday, and the mobile-first workflow, I did the opposite and it wasn't too complicated but because of this I can see that my mobile version isn't pixel perfect.


### Continued development

I need to focus on my "perfect" workflow and my html structure.
